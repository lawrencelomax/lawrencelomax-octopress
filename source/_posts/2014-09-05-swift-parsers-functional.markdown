In the [previous post]() we built a ```decode``` function to parse data out from XML and into an ```Animal``` Model using Imperative techniques. This required some efforts in order to satisfy some of the robustness requirements from the [first post]().

In this post we'll cover how we can use Functional Programming techniques on top of the language features of Swift to decode XML to an ```Animal``` model. This post assumes that you are comfortable with the [Parameterized Types and Generics](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/Generics.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH26-XID_278).

### Thinking Functionally

I'm using the fantastic and lightweight [Swiftz](https://github.com/maxpow4h/swiftz/) for go-to implementations[^swiftz-lightweight] of many [Higher-Order Functions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher-order_function). It also has a great implementation of the [```Result``` type from the previous post]().

One important concept in Functional Programming is that functions can be thought of as [First-Class types](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-class_function) just like any other variable or constant in code. Objective-C has had blocks for some time now, allowing us to think in terms of passing functions around; assigning a block to a property of a Object. However this isn't the same thing as First-Class functions. Swift allows Functions to be First-Class whilst providing equivalence in functions no matter how they are declared, a [Closure in Swift](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/mac/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/Closures.html) is just another kind of function [just like a method](http://oleb.net/blog/2014/07/swift-instance-methods-curried-functions/) or [Free Function](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/Functions.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH10-XID_243). Blocks are no longer the best way of passing around a computation, we can consider the equivalence of functions declared with ```func``` in a Global or Class scope with local Closures:

	let intToNumber:  Int -> NSNumber = NSNumber.numberWithInt
	let intToNumber1: Int -> NSNumber = { NSNumber.numberWithInt($0) }

By now it should be second nature to think of the concatenation of two Strings using the [+ operator](http://swifter.natecook.com/operator/pls/). As functions are types like any other, two functions can be joined together just like a String.

	public func â€¢<A, B, C>(f: B -> C, g: A -> B) -> A -> C	// The 'compose' operator from Swiftz
	
	func prefixer(prefix: String)(string: String) -> String { // Equivalent to String -> String -> String
	  return prefix + string
	}
	func postfixer(postfix: String)(bar: String) -> String { // Equivalent to String -> String -> String
	  return string + postfix
	}
	
	let happyPrefix = prefixer("ðŸ˜ƒ") // String -> String. The first String argument of 'prefixer' is applied.
	let sadPostfix = postfixer("ðŸ˜ž") // String -> String. The first String argument of 'postfixer' is applied.
	let infixer = happyPrefix â€¢ sadPostfix // String -> String. Two functions are joined, the output of the first becomes the input of the second.
	let string = infixer("Good Morning") // "ðŸ˜ƒ Good Morning ðŸ˜ž"

In this example, the Swiftz [compose operator (â€¢)](https://github.com/maxpow4h/swiftz/blob/master/swiftz_core/swiftz_core/Functions.swift#L59) is used in conjunction with [Curried Functions](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/Declarations.html). This might look a little crazy for now, but two important concepts are:

1. A specialized function can be created from a curried function, by applying some, but not all of the arguments.
2. New functions can be created locally by composing other functions with fancy operators.

### Building new Parsers

With the idea of composing functions [without having to declare one](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/Declarations.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH34-XID_598) can be carried over to our problem of decoding XML to a Model;  A specialized Parser function can be made for each of the values that need to be parsed out in the Model. In order to construct an [```Animal``` Model]() three parsers are required, with the values placed into the context of a ```Result``` for failure information:

	let kindParser: XMLParsableType -> Result<String> = ...
	let nameParser: XMLParsableType -> Result<String> = ...
	let urlParser: XMLParsableType -> Result<String> = ...

Further, we can think of each of the properties of a decoded ```Animal``` as the application of the above functions to the source ```XMLParsableType``` from the XML Document.

	let kind: Result<String> = typeParser(xml)
	let name: Result<String> = typeParser(xml)
	let url: Result<String> urlParser(xml)

We've allready seen that we can use Swift's Optional Chaining in our parser to limit the number of occurences of handling failure. However, ```Result``` isn't a blessed by the language with [special syntax for chaining](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/OptionalChaining.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH21-XID_356). It would be great to get the same behaviour for the Result type.

Turns out that Swiftz has the [following function declared](https://github.com/maxpow4h/swiftz/blob/master/swiftz_core/swiftz_core/Optional.swift#L42)[^swiftz-generics-simplification]:

	public func >>-<A, B>(a: Result<A>, f: A -> Result<B>) -> Result<B>

It is called ['Bind'](http://bit.ly/1weNYBM) and it can be described in the following way:

> _"If the parameter *a* is a Value case of the result apply the function *f* returning the *Result* of *f*. If the parameter *a* is an Error, just return the original *Result*"_

Sounds the same as Optional Chaining! In fact Optional Chaining [can be defined in this way](https://github.com/maxpow4h/swiftz/blob/master/swiftz_core/swiftz_core/Optional.swift#L42). It should be possible to construct a ```Result<String>``` for the  ```kind``` value of an ```Animal``` this way:

	let kind: Result<String> = xml.parseChildren("type").first >>- { $0.parseText() } // Compiler Error!

Damn, looks like the types don't match up since the ```kind``` value should be a ```Result<String>``` instead of a ```String?```. Besides, this looks much worse with needing to use an inline closure to invert the ```parseText``` 0-arg instance method on ```xml``` into a function that takes an ```xml``` parameter and executes ```parseText```. There has to be a better way of doing this...

### XMLParser: A Helper

A new approach is to create a few Helper Functions that build on top of the basic functionality of ```XMLParsableType```[^associated-types] to extract a Single child of a given Element name, providing the value in the context of a ```Result``` type, and accept the ```XMLParsableType``` as a parameter of function that isn't bound to an instance:

	public final class XMLParser {
		public class func parseChild<X: XMLParsableType>(elementName: String)(xml: X) -> Result<X> 
		public class func parseText<X: XMLParsableType>(xml: X) -> Result<String>
	}

This can then be used to extract out the ```kind``` value with our understanding of the ```Bind```[^breaking-down-bind] operator:

	let kind: Result<String> = XMLParser.parseChild("kind")(xml: xml) >>- XMLParser.parseText

Now we're talking! The ```XMLParser.parseText``` function is not invoked directly and is placed into a chain of operations to extract out text of an XML Element. These functions are being joined as if it were any other type of data.

The  ```name``` property of the ```Animal``` model is nested a few XML Elements deep, but it can be extracted by chaining the Parsing functions in the same way:

	let name: Result<String> = XMLParser.parseChild("nested_nonsense")(xml: xml) >>- XMLParser.parseChild("name") >>- XMLParser.parseText 

The ```XMLParser.parseChild("name")``` expression evaluates to a function of ```XMLParsableType -> Result<XMLParsableType>``` instead of just a ```Result``` value. We're seeing that currying is being used to create a specialized Parser function for a specific XML element, chained together in a sequence of functions.

This is the heart of Function Composition, with ```Bind``` performing the behaviour of continuing on success, bailing out as soon as an Error occurs. The possibility of failure within any of the sequences of operations is an essential property of this Parser. Previously this was handled by Optional Chaining and ```if``` statements in the [Imperative version](). Using ```>>-``` there isn't a branching statement in sight[^non-optional-guarantees].

### Common Operations

There appeares to be some common chained functions appearing. These can be extracted out and into the ```XMLParser``` class[^xmlparser-class] and built using the same Higher-Order Functions and other functions and methods that have been defined for ```XMLParserType```

	extension XMLParser {
	    public class func parseChildText<X: XMLParsableType>(elementName: String)(xml: X) -> Result<String> {
	      let textParser: X -> Result<String> = promoteXmlError("Could not parse text for child \(elementName)") â€¢ { $0.parseText()}
	      return self.parseChild(elementName)(xml: xml) >>- textParser
	    }
		
	    public class func parseChildRecursive<X: XMLParsableType>(elementNames: [String])(xml: X) -> Result<X> {
	      return elementNames.reduce(Result.value(xml)) { (parsable: Result<X>, currentElementName) in
	        return parsable >>- self.parseChild(currentElementName)
	      }
	    }
	    
	    public class func parseChildRecusiveText<X: XMLParsableType>(elementNames: [String])(xml: X) -> Result<String> {
	      let textParser: X -> Result<String> = promoteXmlError("Could not parse text for child \(elementNames.last)") â€¢ { $0.parseText()}
	      return self.parseChildRecursive(elementNames)(xml: xml) >>- textParser
	    }
	}

[```reduce```](http://swifter.natecook.com/func/reduce/) is another Higher-Order function of the [```Sequence``` type](http://swifter.natecook.com/protocol/SequenceType/) making an appearance. Using it means that the ```parseChildRecursive``` [doesn't need to be implemented in a recursive manner](http://bit.ly/1qZxDCb).

These functions can now be used with in the Animal ```decode``` function to make extracting data from the XML more obvious:

	let kind: Result<String> = XMLParser.parseChildText("kind")(xml: xml)
	let name: Result<String> = XMLParser.parseChildTextRecursive(["nested_nonsense", "name"])

Lovely.

### Parsers for Other Types	

We've seen that the definitions inside the ```XMLParser``` Helper don't provide methods for interpreting the ```String``` of a XML Text element as every possible Type as Numeric and Complex types within an XML document are represented in textual form. Our Model classes are concerned with Numeric types such as ```Double``` and ```Int```, so the parsing of these types will need to be incorporated into the ```decode``` method.

Unlike JSON, there is no [explicit syntax for a Numeric value](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON#Data_types.2C_syntax_and_example), so the interpretation of these types isn't a requirement of an XML Parser. Instead of bloating the ```XMLParser``` class with every variation of interpreting Text as a other Types, the Parser functions for values in the Model can be composed with ```XMLParser``` functions and other functions that interpret ```String```s as the other types.

Coercing a value from a String to a Numeric type may not always work. The String '14123' can be interpreted as an ```Int``` but the value ```134djk23``` cannot. Again, this falls into our notion of Model decoding failure. The ```NSNumberFormatter``` class is a Cocoa way of interpreting Strings as Numbers, we can write an extension for the  ```Int``` type to intepret a ```String``` as an ```Int```, with ```Optional.None``` used to representing failure.

	public extension Int {
	  public static func parseString(string: String) -> Int? {
	    let formatter = NSNumberFormatter()
	    let number = formatter.numberFromString(string)
	    return number?.integerValue
	  }
	}

As previously mentioned, Cocoa APIs in Swift expose failure as the ```nil```/```.None``` case of an Optional Type[^nserror-failure]. However, our Parser requires the additional information in a ```Result``` type. One approach is to extend Cocoa classes with additional methods that return a ```Result``` instead of an ```Optional```, but this might not be the ideal solution[^parsing-bloating-categories]. Instead we can again think in terms of Function Composition to make a function that returns ```Result<Int>``` instead of ```Int?```

For example, a definition of ```toiletCount``` requires interpreting a ```String``` in the XML as an ```Int``` in the model. This function can be built from closures:

	let toiletCountParser: String -> Result<Int> = { promoteDecodeError("Could not parse 'disabled_parking")(value: Int.parseString($0)) }

Or we can use the [```Compose``` and ```Bind``` Operators again]():

	let toiletCountParser: String -> Result<Int> = promoteDecodeError("Could not parse 'disabled_parking") â€¢ Int.parseString
	let toiletCount =  XMLParser.parseChildText(["facilities", "toilet"])(xml: xml) >>- toiletCountParser

The code also has the benefit of using the ```XMLDecoderType``` protocol as the ```decode``` functions can be reused when the Models form a heirarchy. In this case there are a number of ```Animal``` Models belonging to a ```Zoo```:

	let animals = XMLParser.parseChild("animals")(xml: xml) >>- XMLParser.parseChildren("animal") >>- resultMap(Animal.decode)

The ```resultMap``` function is like a regular ```map``` on an Array, except with the return of a ```Result.Error``` if any of the applications of the ```map``` function fail:

	public func resultMap<A, B>(map: A -> Result<B>)(array: [A]) -> Result<[B]>

### Applicatives

Lets assume that we have the correct code that produces a ```Result``` container for each of values that needs to be extracted from the XML and assigned to the Model. The computation that needs to be performed is _"If all of the Results corresponding to each of the Values are Successful, return our Model with the values applied inside a Result context, otherwise return the first Error Result."

This computation can be performed by Currying the Constructor for the Model and then applying each Result in order. A Curried 'Constructor'[^constructor-factory-method] for the ```Animal``` Model looks like this:

    static func build(type: String)(name: String)(url: NSURL) -> Animal {
      return self(type: type, name: name, url: url)
    }

Given that we have the previous ```Result```s corresponding to each of the parameters the computation can be broken down:

    let type: Result<String> = ...
    let name: Result<String> = ...
    let url: Result<NSURL> = ...
    
	let build: String -> String -> NSURL -> Animal = self.build
    let first: Result<String -> NSURL -> Animal> = self.build <^> type
    let second: Result<NSURL -> Animal> = first <*> name
    let third: Result<Animal> = second <*> url

It should be a little clearer what is going on given the additional annotations for each value, these defintions should probably be removed if the compiler can infer them. There are some additional infix operators doing the heavy lifting of pulling values out of the ```Result``` context and sticking them back in again.

Firstly, the ```fmap``` operator:

	public func <^><A, B>(f: A -> B, a: Result<A>) -> Result<B>

This function is used to apply a function to a the value contained in the ```Result``` context. The function itself doesn't ever have to be aware of the ```Result``` context with the implementation of ```<^>``` being based on what the ```Result``` context represents.

Secondly the ```apply``` operator:

	public func <*><A, B>(f: Result<A -> B>, a: Result<A>) -> Result<B>

This is another variation in the types of arguments that are accepted. Following the application of each of these operators in sequence, it becomes like balancing an equation; applying an argument to a curried function knocks one of the arguments off.

Between ```<^>```, ```<*>``` and ```>>-``` all the combinations of applying Values to Functions inside and outside of a ```Result``` are covered. These instruments for moving data around inside the ```Result``` context also apply to other context types[^monads-as-contexts].

### Teach the Controversy

There's a lot to take in here, some of the benefits should be clear, others are a bit more subtle. I don't deny some of this doesn't have a cost in terms of a leaning curve, it can look very alien at first. However, this isn't less true of a [Domain Specific Language](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/AutolayoutPG/VisualFormatLanguage/VisualFormatLanguage.html) that we can graft on top of Objective-C[^objc-dsls] or with a [more flexible language](http://robots.thoughtbot.com/writing-a-domain-specific-language-in-ruby). The result on the code can be summed up as:

> _"In the Imperative implementation Parsing computations are chained with conditional statements and The effect on the code is the usage of the ```Result``` type and Functional Operators to chain com"_

There's a lot of concern that Operator Overloading is going to lead to a lot of Smart People doing some very silly things[^blocks-operator-overloading] for the purpose of making dense and concise code. The reality of these operators is that they are small in number and aren't specific to just ```Optional``` and ```Result```. As Arithmetic Operators deal with Numeric values, Functional Operators operators deal with the transformation of Functions themselves. These concepts are taken from other languages, so they aren't at all specific to Swift.

There are some very alien concepts when coming from Objective-C, treating *functions-as-types* and composable like any other stucture-or-object. However some of the concepts are incredibly familiar with a computational pattern identical to [Sending Messages to Nil](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/cocoa/conceptual/ProgrammingWithObjectiveC/WorkingwithObjects/WorkingwithObjects.html), which can be challenging to some Objective-C newcomers depending on where they have come from! The ```Result``` type goes just a little bit further by providing us with a ```NSError``` when something goes wrong. Compare this to the idiomatic way of returning (by-reference) an ```NSError``` in Objective-C 

Sure, Objective-C has the benefit of a preprocessor to graft new features onto the language to reduce the amount of boiler-plate required[^macro-error-handling], but these bring other problems along with them. The Compiler is fully aware of the types of all of the Functions that are transformed leaving no room for pesky ambiguity. The chances of a runtime error because of a [keypath not existing](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8561558/objective-c-keyvaluecoding-how-to-avoid-an-exception-with-valueforkeypath) or the type being [different to the one expected by the code](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2455161/unrecognized-selector-sent-to-instance) are diminished.

I honestly believe its worth jumping the conceptual hurdle, for the practicality of coding and the curiosity of learning something new. I don't this post can do that, but there are many other posts that do a fantastic job of explaining this different way of thinking.

Thanks for Reading! As a bonus, the [next post]() will focus on how ```XMLParsableType``` can be implemented in a variety of ways.

---

[^swiftz-lightweight]: Swiftz has separated its functionality across a [core](https://github.com/maxpow4h/swiftz/tree/master/swiftz_core) library and the [library proper](https://github.com/maxpow4h/swiftz/tree/master/swiftz). This post will only use the Core library.

[^associated-types]: They consume a Protocol, abstracting away how the XML Parser is implemented. As the Protocol has an associated type requirement it has to be fulfilled with Generics. Composed behaviours don't pollute the Implementation of the Protocol but still augment the behaviour.

[^xmlparser-implementation]: The Implementation for this class is in the [next post in this series]().

[^swiftz-generics-simplification]: I'm lying, I've changed the Generic Parameters from ```VA``` & ```VB``` to ```A``` & ```B```

[^hypothetical-xml]: These assumptions actually hold true for a [webservice to be consumed](http://www.livedepartureboards.co.uk/ldbws/) in an Application I was prototyping. Depending on the Webservice an Application is consuming, there's a great deal of assumptions that can be made to reduce the complexity of an Implementation.

[^lazy-evaluated-functional-programming]: One of the interesting aspects of Haskell is [Lazy Evaluation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazy_evaluation), in particular how it applies to building up a [data structure and then traversing it](http://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/people/staff/dat/miranda/whyfp90.pdf).

[^breaking-down-bind]: When starting out it can be really helpful to do this, it makes inspecting the types of each of the elements in the chain more visible. You can use Alt+Click on the value name to get XCode to print out the inferred type. Its also a good illustration of the power of type inference.

[^non-optional-guarantees]: Swift makes strong guarantees about the existance of values, there's no need to check for the existance of values in arguments that are non-optional. In an Objective-C implementation this contract can be enforced with a litany of assertions. If the language and compiler can enforce these guarantees we've got a huge productivity win on our hands.

[^xmlparser-class]: As the functions consume a Protocol with associated type requirements the Protocol type has to be defined as a Generic type. The functions are [Pure](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function) in that they do not consume or modify any Global State, only the arguments are used. The guarantee of the no side-effects cannot be enforced in Swift. In essence the class is a bunch of similar functions that are kind-of-namespaced as Class methods of a ```final``` class with no constructor.

[^model-mapping-traditional]: I certainly remember writing this kind of thing by hand, before [Java annotations could be used for Code Generation](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/jaxb/intro/).

[^monadic-parser]: The concept of a 'Parser' as a distinct type that implements the 'Monad' Typeclass [does indeed exist in Pure functional language](http://eprints.nottingham.ac.uk/223/1/pearl.pdf).

[^constructor-factory-method]: 'Factory Method' is probably a better term for this since a 'Constructor' is a term reserved to ```init``` methods in Swift. 

[^nested-branching]: It would look [something like this](https://gist.github.com/lawrencelomax/00ea2c00c9b6ca5bb4ab)

[^monads-as-contexts]: ```Optional``` and ```Result``` are examples of Functors and Monads. This [fantastic article](http://adit.io/posts/2013-04-17-functors,_applicatives,_and_monads_in_pictures.html) covers the operators in a visual way. There's more of these (Monads) than you might first think and its a [crucial part of many functional languages](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Monad#Interesting_monads).

[^parsing-bloating-categories]: And it could be damaging to the codebase. Cocoa Classes could easily become polluted with ```Result``` variants of every possible method that could fail and this would continue over time as more classes are required to be parsed. More importantly it is not possible for a General ```Result``` returning type to have some of the crucial context surrounding a failure. We want our ```NSError```s to contain the Element within the XML responsible for the failure, an Extension method would lose this context. _'Failed to interpret 'toilet' as an Int'_ is preferable to _'Failed to interpret '123a' as an Int'_

[^blocks-operator-overloading]: This happens when any [*'new'*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operator_overloading#1980s) language feature comes along. I know I abused blocks when they appeared in Objective-C.

[^macro-error-handling]: In Objective-C this can be handled with [Macros and Early Return](https://github.com/rentzsch/NSXReturnThrowError), but we can't rewrite/mangle the rules of the language in Swift as we don't have Macros.

[^decoder-protocols]: This is heavily inspired by the ThoughtBot article on JSON Parsing in Swift. In my Project I have multiple decoder types for JSON, XML and CSV.

[^swiftz-lightweight]: Swiftz has a Core library as well as a more full-featured Framework. There's a lot of interesting stuffin the Full library, but just getting started with the Core is a good place to start.
